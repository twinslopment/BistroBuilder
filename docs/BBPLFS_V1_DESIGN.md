# BB Procedural Layout & Furnishing System (BBPLFS)

Status: V1 design in progress
Branch: `feature/bbplfs-v1`

## Permanent principles
- BBPLFS assists the existing classic Edit/Build Mode; it never replaces it.
- Global Understanding + Selective Generation: the full premises may be understood, but only the explicit Design Scope may be generated or modified.
- Manual and procedural work can be mixed in any order.
- Once a generated result is accepted, it becomes normal editable content; it is not locked into a procedural mode.
- Tool-First: AI interprets intent and context; deterministic tools generate and validate layouts whenever possible.
- BBPLFS does not duplicate BBSIS, Navigation, Interaction & Reservation, Economy, or Edit Mode authority.

## Block 1 — System contract
BBPLFS is responsible for:
- understanding the purchased/rented premises;
- interpreting the player's requested scope and design intent;
- selecting compatible furnishing/equipment candidates;
- generating, comparing and optimizing layout alternatives;
- requesting spatial validation from BBSIS;
- requesting circulation evaluation from Navigation;
- delivering previews/results to Edit Mode for accept/modify/cancel.

BBPLFS is not responsible for:
- final spatial validity;
- pathfinding or crowd simulation;
- logical reservations/interactions;
- authoritative prices or financial transactions;
- materializing construction outside Edit Mode;
- modifying areas outside the active Design Scope.
## Block 2 — Premises Model
`PremisesModel` is a lightweight working representation of the acquired premises.
It references existing authoritative data instead of duplicating it.

It contains:
- premises identity and revision;
- detected spaces/rooms and their usable contours;
- walls, openings, doors, relevant windows, columns and fixed obstacles;
- connections between spaces and external/internal access points;
- existing objects and their editability/lock state;
- derived potentially usable areas for cheap filtering;
- semantic observations and confidence where interpretation is not structural fact.

`PotentiallyUsable` is never equivalent to BBSIS validity.

`DesignScope` is separate from `PremisesModel` and defines exactly what one BBPLFS operation may touch:
- selection;
- zone;
- room;
- multiple rooms;
- whole premises.

The scope also records objects to preserve, objects that may be moved, and objects that are untouchable.
Relevant Edit Mode structural changes invalidate only the affected premises data where practical.

## Block 3 — AI + LayoutBrief
AI is part of BBPLFS V1 from day one.
Its role is semantic interpretation, not arbitrary spatial placement.
AI may:
- classify the requested function and style;
- interpret natural-language priorities, capacity wishes and restrictions;
- use the Premises Model to explain suitable or unsuitable choices;
- translate the request into a validated `LayoutBrief`.

AI may not:
- emit authoritative coordinates/rotations;
- declare BBSIS or Navigation validity;
- expand the Design Scope without explicit player action;
- assume demolition, construction or relocation of locked/fixed elements;
- silently relax a hard player constraint.

### LayoutBrief — minimum contract
- `ScopeRef` — exact Design Scope to operate on.
- `SpaceFunction` — dining, kitchen, bar, waiting, support, etc.
- `GoalProfile` — Balanced, MaxCapacity, MaxComfort, ServiceEfficient or Premium.
- `CapacityTarget` — preferred value/range when relevant.
- `StyleTags` — compact semantic style request.
- `BudgetLimitRef` — optional authoritative budget/cost context reference.
- `PreserveExisting` — what existing work must remain.
- `RequiredElements` — mandatory functional elements requested by the player.
- `ForbiddenElements` — explicitly excluded elements.
- `HardConstraints` — requirements that may not be relaxed.
- `SoftPreferences` — preferences the scorer may trade off.

The brief contains intent, not placement instructions.
### Interpretation rules
1. Explicit player input overrides AI inference.
2. Structural facts from the Premises Model override AI assumptions.
3. Missing non-critical preferences use deterministic project defaults.
4. Missing critical information is requested only when it changes the meaning or feasibility of the operation.
5. AI uncertainty is never converted into a hard constraint.
6. If the requested result is infeasible, BBPLFS reports the conflict and may offer feasible alternatives; it does not silently violate requirements.
7. The same `LayoutBrief` can also be produced by normal UI controls, so layout generation does not depend on free-text AI being available.

### Examples
`"Comedor contemporáneo para 40 personas con buena circulación"`
→ scope selected by player; function Dining; capacity 40; style Contemporary; circulation/service preference high; remaining fields defaulted.

`"Completa esta sala pero no muevas las mesas que ya puse"`
→ current scope; preserve existing tables; generator may only fill available remainder.

`"Hazme todo el restaurante"`
→ valid only when the player explicitly selects/authorizes whole-premises scope; otherwise the AI must not expand scope.

## Closed decisions so far
- Block 1 System Contract: CLOSED.
- Block 2 Premises Model: CLOSED.
- Block 3 AI + LayoutBrief: CLOSED.
- Next design block: Asset Layout Profiles + Furnishing Sets.## Block 4 — Asset Layout Profiles
`AssetLayoutProfile` is the small BBPLFS-facing description of an asset. It does not duplicate full asset, BBSIS or Economy data.

Minimum fields:
- `AssetRef` — canonical catalog asset.
- `LayoutRole` — table, seat, counter, appliance, storage, decor, etc.
- `LayoutFamily` — interchangeable family used to reduce search space.
- `FunctionTags` — functions this asset can fulfil.
- `StyleTags` — compact visual/style classification.
- `QualityTier` — coarse quality/premium level where relevant.
- `PlacementType` — floor, wall, support surface or other supported placement.
- `AllowedOrientations` — only when the asset is not freely rotatable for layout purposes.
- `CompatibilityTags` — semantic compatibility with set slots/other assets.
- `FastFootprintRef` — revisioned derived footprint/envelope used only for cheap candidate generation.
- `BBSISDescriptorRef` — authoritative spatial-validation reference.
- `CostRef` — authoritative economy/catalog price reference.

Rules:
- Asset dimensions, ports, Work Edges, Seat Bays, sweeps and true spatial validity remain authoritative outside BBPLFS.
- `FastFootprintRef` is disposable cache data; if stale, it is rebuilt from canonical data.
- Visual variants that behave identically may share one layout family/profile and differ only at concrete asset selection.
- Assets4All/catalog authoring should populate as much of this profile automatically as reliable metadata permits; uncertain semantic tags remain reviewable rather than silently trusted.
## Block 5 — Furnishing Sets
A `FurnishingSet` is a functional recipe, not a prefab and not a permanent ownership container.

It defines:
- `SetRole` — functional purpose, e.g. DiningSet4, BarRun, PrepStation.
- required slots and quantities;
- optional slots;
- compatibility requirements for each slot;
- simple layout relationships needed to generate the set: around, aligned, attached, repeated or adjacent;
- permitted arrangement families when the function requires them.

Example:
`DiningSet4` = 1 dining table + 4 compatible dining seats arranged around it.

Rules:
- Sets describe what must exist together; BBSIS decides whether the concrete arrangement is spatially usable.
- Sets may be partially satisfied by existing manual objects inside the Design Scope.
- Locked/manual objects can therefore become fixed members of a generated set without being recreated.
- A set may substitute compatible concrete assets without changing its functional meaning.
- The generator first works with a small compatible candidate pool/layout families, then resolves concrete assets before final BBSIS/Navigation validation.
- BBPLFS must never enumerate the entire catalog combinatorially when equivalent families can be collapsed.
- Once the player accepts the result, set membership is not required to keep the objects editable; normal Edit Mode remains authoritative for subsequent manual editing.

## Asset matching rule
Concrete asset selection uses deterministic filtering first:
1. required function/slot compatibility;
2. availability and scope restrictions;
3. hard player requirements;
4. footprint/layout compatibility;
5. style, quality, cost and soft preferences for ranking.

AI may translate player language into tags/preferences, but it may not bypass these filters or invent catalog assets.
## Current closure state
- Block 1 System Contract: CLOSED.
- Block 2 Premises Model: CLOSED.
- Block 3 AI + LayoutBrief: CLOSED.
- Block 4 Asset Layout Profiles: CLOSED.
- Block 5 Furnishing Sets: CLOSED.
- Next design block: Layout Generator — candidate positions, room patterns, irregular geometry and candidate generation strategy.

## Block 6 — Layout Generator

The V1 generator uses a staged deterministic pipeline, not free placement by AI.

### 6.1 Input
The generator receives:
- `PremisesModel`;
- active `DesignScope`;
- validated `LayoutBrief`;
- compatible `FurnishingSets` and asset families;
- preserved/locked existing content.

### 6.2 Placement domain
The generator derives only plausible placement domains inside the selected scope.
Sources include:
- usable floor regions;
- wall bands;
- corners;
- room axes;
- adaptive grids;
- existing alignment lines;
- anchors created by fixed/manual content;
- functional adjacency zones.

The domain is sparse and semantic: BBPLFS must not brute-force every coordinate of the room.
### 6.3 Candidate generation
For each furnishing module, BBPLFS creates a bounded set of candidate poses using:
- wall-aligned placement;
- row/column patterns;
- staggered patterns when useful;
- center/axis placement;
- corner placement;
- adjacency to compatible modules;
- continuation of manually established patterns;
- a coarse adaptive grid for free placement.

Only meaningful orientations from the asset/family profile are generated.
Candidates failing cheap containment, boundary or obvious-overlap tests are discarded immediately.

### 6.4 Irregular geometry
Irregular/concave rooms are supported in V1.
BBPLFS uses polygon containment plus configuration-space style exclusion for fast geometric pruning.
No-Fit Polygon / Minkowski-style techniques may be used internally where they reduce repeated overlap tests, but they are geometry tools, not the global layout solver.

### 6.5 Layout construction
Layouts are assembled from candidates incrementally.
The default search strategy is a bounded heuristic/beam search with deterministic ordering and seeded tie-breaking.
It prioritizes the most constrained or functionally important modules first, then expands the best partial layouts.
Branch-and-bound pruning removes partial layouts that cannot beat current feasible candidates or cannot satisfy hard targets.
CP-SAT is retained as a targeted solver option for dense discrete subproblems, not as the mandatory engine for every room.
It is especially suitable when candidate positions are already discrete and many optional rectangular placements must be selected without overlap.

### 6.6 Validation ladder
Generation uses three levels:
1. cheap BBPLFS geometric precheck;
2. BBSIS validation for shortlisted layouts;
3. Navigation evaluation for layouts that pass BBSIS.

A BBPLFS precheck never means spatial validity.
BBSIS remains the authority for Seat Bays, Work Edges, Ports, Sweeps, doors, envelopes and spatial gates.
Navigation remains the authority for reachability, routes, circulation and traffic quality.

### 6.7 Candidate budget
Search is explicitly bounded by time/work budgets.
BBPLFS returns the best valid layouts found rather than searching for a mathematically proven global optimum.
The generator must degrade gracefully on large/complex rooms by reducing candidate density and search breadth, never by relaxing hard constraints.

### 6.8 Determinism
Same premises revision + same brief + same catalog revision + same seed must reproduce the same candidate ordering and result set.
Randomized exploration is allowed only through an explicit stored seed.
This makes previews, saves, testing and debugging reproducible.
### 6.9 Output
The generator returns a small shortlist of valid candidate layouts, normally 3–5 when enough distinct solutions exist.
Near-duplicates are removed using simple structural differences such as module count, dominant orientation, aisle structure and zone occupancy.
It is valid to return fewer candidates when the room or hard constraints do not support meaningful alternatives.

Generated content never extends beyond `DesignScope`.
Existing manual content marked preserve/locked is treated as part of the environment, not regenerated.

### V1 generator decisions
- No AI coordinate placement.
- No exhaustive continuous search.
- No single packing algorithm as the whole solution.
- Semantic sparse candidate generation first.
- Cheap geometry for pruning only.
- Bounded heuristic/beam search is the default layout builder.
- Branch-and-bound pruning is used where useful.
- CP-SAT is optional for appropriate discrete subproblems.
- NFP/Minkowski-style geometry is optional for irregular-shape pruning.
- BBSIS and Navigation validate shortlisted layouts through their own authority.
- Search is reproducible and time/work bounded.

## Closed decisions so far
- Block 1 System Contract: CLOSED.
- Block 2 Premises Model: CLOSED.
- Block 3 AI + LayoutBrief: CLOSED.
- Block 4 Asset Layout Profiles: CLOSED.
- Block 5 Furnishing Sets: CLOSED.
- Block 6 Layout Generator: CLOSED.
## Block 7 — Constraint Model, Validation, Scoring and Optimization

BBPLFS separates non-negotiable validity from preferences.

### 7.1 Hard constraints
A candidate is rejected if any hard constraint fails.
Sources are:
- explicit player requirements in `LayoutBrief`;
- active `DesignScope` and preserve/lock rules;
- required furnishing-set composition;
- catalog/asset compatibility and availability;
- BBSIS authoritative spatial validation;
- Navigation authoritative reachability/critical circulation requirements;
- authoritative budget ceiling when the player defines one as mandatory.

Hard constraints are never converted into penalties and are never relaxed to obtain a higher score.
Each rejection keeps machine-readable reason codes so the UI/AI can explain why a request is infeasible.

### 7.2 Soft objectives
Valid candidates are compared using a small normalized objective vector:
- `CapacityScore`;
- `ComfortScore`;
- `ServiceEfficiencyScore`;
- `CirculationQualityScore`;
- `AestheticCoherenceScore`;
- `CostFitnessScore`.

No additional objective is added unless it changes player-visible decisions.

### 7.3 Metric authority
BBPLFS owns only the comparison formula.
- Capacity comes from the realized functional layout.
- Comfort uses BBPLFS layout-level spacing/composition metrics plus BBSIS results where relevant.
- Service efficiency consumes Navigation route/service-cost metrics and layout structure.
- Circulation quality consumes Navigation results; BBPLFS does not recreate pathfinding.
- Aesthetic coherence uses deterministic layout/style rules: alignment, repetition, spacing consistency, family/style compatibility and composition balance.
- Cost fitness uses authoritative catalog/Economy values; BBPLFS does not own prices or transactions.

### 7.4 Validation ladder
For each promising candidate:
1. BBPLFS cheap geometry/semantic checks;
2. BBSIS validates true spatial usability;
3. Navigation validates required access and evaluates circulation;
4. hard budget/brief constraints are checked against authoritative values;
5. only fully valid candidates enter scoring.

External validators return structured metrics and reason codes, not placement decisions.
BBPLFS may use those results to choose another candidate or request a new generation pass.

### 7.5 Scoring
Each soft objective is normalized to a stable 0–1 range using project tuning data.
The active `GoalProfile` supplies weights and optional minimum quality floors.
Final ranking is a weighted score only after all hard constraints and profile floors pass.

This keeps the five player modes as profiles of one optimizer rather than separate algorithms.

### 7.6 Goal profiles
V1 profiles:
- `Balanced` — no single objective dominates.
- `MaxCapacity` — favors capacity while preserving mandatory comfort/circulation floors.
- `MaxComfort` — favors spacing and circulation over seat count.
- `ServiceEfficient` — favors service routes and circulation quality.
- `Premium` — favors comfort, aesthetic coherence and higher-quality compatible assets; it never means spending money for its own sake.

Exact weights are tuning data, not hardcoded architecture.
They can be adjusted without changing the solver.

### 7.7 Optimization loop
The optimizer:
1. ranks valid layouts under the selected profile;
2. keeps a small elite set;
3. applies bounded local improvements such as small translations, orientation swaps, equivalent-module substitutions or row-spacing adjustments;
4. revalidates any change that can affect BBSIS or Navigation;
5. stops when the work budget is exhausted or improvement becomes negligible.

Local refinement never changes the requested Design Scope or hard requirements.

### 7.8 Alternatives and diversity
The final shortlist is selected from high-scoring valid layouts with a minimum structural difference.
Difference may use module distribution, dominant orientation, aisle structure, zone occupancy and capacity.
A slightly lower-scoring candidate may be retained when it provides a meaningfully different player choice.

BBPLFS does not maintain a complex Pareto subsystem in V1.

### 7.9 Infeasible requests
If no valid layout exists, BBPLFS returns:
- the failed hard constraints;
- the best near-feasible diagnostic candidates when useful;
- deterministic relaxation suggestions ordered by smallest impact.

Relaxations are proposals only. The player must explicitly change the brief/scope before regeneration.
AI may phrase the explanation but cannot silently apply the relaxation.

### V1 decisions
- Hard validity and soft scoring are strictly separated.
- BBSIS and Navigation remain authoritative validators.
- One normalized objective vector powers all player modes.
- Goal-profile weights are data-driven tuning values.
- Weighted ranking is used only after validity and minimum floors pass.
- Optimization uses bounded local refinement, not an unbounded metaheuristic.
- Diverse high-quality alternatives are retained without a heavy Pareto architecture.
- Failure is explainable through structured reason codes and explicit relaxation proposals.
